            In March 2013, Frank Byrne - Builders was approached by Laurie Davidson and Matt Toynbee on behalf of the Fundraising Committee for the Golden Bay Integrated Health Centre, regarding the building of a house, that when finished, would be auctioned off as a fundraiser for the new Health Centre.
            The Fundraising Committee had committed to raising $800,000 to $1m towards the Health Centre from the local community over the 2012/2013 year and this was to be the last ‘big push’ project.
            The Kohikiko Place section at Pohara had been offered at a reduced price by the subdivision developers JP &amp; GS Gregory and Jennian Homes donated the plans. 
            Matt and Laurie (Project Manager) required a Licensed Building Practitioner to back the project for consent purposes and Franks building reputation made him an ideal person to approach.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-2">
            We saw our commitment to this community project as something being beneficial to every resident of Golden Bay – from childbirth through to elderly care and an essential part of our health care in Golden Bay, well into the future. 
            Therefore, we personally committed $12,000 of labour towards the project immediately, which would enable the build to commemce – our donation allowed the foundations to go down, frames up and roof on. 
            All completed under the keen direction of our staff and local volunteers, as available.
            Donations of labour and materials were volunteered either at cost or for free from suppliers and sub-contractors locally and further afield, including landscaping, sunshade and hot-mix driveway to complete the exterior of the property. 
            Any other expenses were underwritten by a very supportive local resident to ensure that nothing would hold up the progress of the project.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-2">
            On a more personal note, Franks Dad, Pat Byrne, was in care at the Golden Bay Community Hospital, from February 2013 and one of the first residents to be moved across to the new Health Centre in June. 
            Pat passed away on 9th July 2013 at the Health Centre but was able to enjoy the new facilities and wonderful, caring staff who are a credit to our community.
            The Project House Build was completed in December 2013. A fundraising auction of donated art from local artists preceded the main event on 25th January 2014, this led to a further $6000+ being added to the fundraising efforts. 
            Property marketing was organised free of charge by Golden Bay First National and concluded with a successful sale of 15 Kohikiko Place. 
            The proceeds from this project completed the target of $1m+ raised by the Golden Bay Community for the Golden Bay Integrated Health Centre.
            A grand effort from a great community and certainly a project that Frank and Cherie, and Frank Byrne, Builders were proud to be part of.
