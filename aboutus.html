                            Frank and Cherie Byrne established “Frank Byrne - Builders” construction business partnership in March 1993. The partnership is managed by Frank, who maintains the day-to-day running of the business through client consultation and on-site construction management, while Cherie completes the general administration for the business.

                            We have an excellent team of qualified builders, who are also Licensed Building Practitioners. Under the guidance of our qualified builders, we also employ general labourers/hammer hands, who have proven to be invaluable to our team.
                            
                            We carry full Trade Insurance in excess of $2m but also take contract insurance for specific projects as required.
                            
                            We are proud to be able to provide excellent workmanship to our clients and have gained an enviable reputation for building in Golden Bay since 1993.

                        <div class="row">We have a strong client base and a good working relationship with various sub-contractors and suppliers involved in the construction business, both locally and further afield.
                            
                            We are a member of Certified Builders Association of New Zealand, which only accepts qualified builders as members and also gives assurance &amp; protection to our clients.
