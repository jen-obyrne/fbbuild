                                going wrong and issues with builders - we were wondering how the build would go? 
                                I am happy to say the build has run very smoothly and has been an enjoyable experience. 
                                Frank and Brooks (FBB foreman) have communicated well, involving meetings with the subbies as required, 
                                throughout the process and the quality of workmanship is outstanding. I would not hesitate to use Frank
